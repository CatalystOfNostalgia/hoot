{"comments": ["In this surprisingly adult PG movie (it's a cop show), all the animals wear clothes, predators no longer eat prey, everyone gets along and life is good. We are in a city populated by anthropomorphic animals, among which are a con-man fox and a cute bunny who is a rookie cop. Our two main characters suddenly find themselves working together as they stumble into a conspiracy that threatens the peace.Three directors (!) and ten writers -- (It always makes me nervous when it takes a committee to create a movie) -- did a good job. The plot unfolds as we admire the grit and determination of one small bunny rabbit who has always wanted to make the world a better place.Celebrity voices and the characters they represent:* Ginnifer Goodwin (\"Once Upon a Time\") is Judy Hopps, an ambitious little bunny who has always dreamed of being a cop. She aces her written tests but flunks the physical part. This only means she works harder (a GOOD lesson!); so we watch her train some more, try again, and succeed. Her life on the police force isn't what she had pictured so she isn't happy, but she IS a smart little bunny!* Idris Elba (\"Luther\") Chief Bogo wants that worthless little rabbit off his force. He sees no future for Judy and doesn't want to see her around. Even Elba's VOICE looms as he forces our frustrated little heroine to be a meter maid despite her sterling results from the academy.* Jason Bateman (\"This is Where I Leave You\") Foxy Nick Wilde is always on the lookout for a new scam. He completely fools sweet-hearted Judy when she first meets him, but she doesn't stay fooled. She isn't above a trick or two, either!* J.K. Simmons (\"Whiplash\") Mayor Lionheart is a politician... period.* Jenny Slate (Lots of TV) Bellwether is the mayor's assistant, overworked and overwhelmed. She befriends Judy at just the right time.* Octavia Spencer (\"The Help\") is Mrs. Otterton, a worried wife who can't seem to get anyone at city hall to look into the mysterious disappearance of her beloved husband...except Judy.* Raymond S Persi (\"Frozen\") I have a special spot in my heart for Flash, the sloth. Watch Judy's incredulous reaction when she realizes how much time it takes him to say a few words! There are many other talented voices who convey parental concern, bureaucratic frustration and ferocious rage, but professional voice actor Persi is a cut above.This is rated PG, so expect a scary chase scene or two and threatening animals, but no profanity or blowie uppie stuff. The artistry is wonderful; the 3D however, is unnecessary.Using motion capture and Computer Generated Imaging, the writing, acting and craftsmanship are brilliant. I'm amazed by the subtle touches in both expression and body language that inhabit today's \"cartoon\" characters. Children in the audience, both young and old, were very, very quiet as they absorbed lessons about trust, bullying, friendship, prejudice, loyalty, determination, family love, and the importance of following one's dream.Oh! And let's not forget Shakira, who was perfect, both as the spokes-gazelle for Zootopia and the vocalist who provides happy-ending dance music for the final credit scroll.", "Directed by Byron Howard (Bolt, Tangled), Rich Moore (Wreck-It Ralph) and Jared Bush (Big Hero 6) from a screenplay by Bush and Phil Johnston (Wreck-It Ralph), Zootopia is an amazing piece of work, top notch on every level from beginning to end. A lot of extremely talented people were involved in the making of this movie and it shows throughout the 108 minutes its on the screen. As entertainment that anyone of any age can enjoy, it doesn't get much better than this.The film begins in a rural small-town elementary school where a young rabbit named Judy Hopps (Della Saba) is in a presentation about what animals can aspire to when they grow up. Judy, we learn, wants to be a cop, to \"help make the world a better place.\" And nothing, it seems, is going to dissuade her from that goal. Flash forward ten years and we see Judy (now voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) going through the police academy, overcoming all manner of challenges to eventually graduate with top marks. And off she goes, ready and eager, to the big city of Zootopia to join the ZPD (Zootopia Police Department) to make her mark in the world.Once there though, reality begins to kick in. Even though Judy was personally recruited by Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons), she doesn't impress Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a stern African buffalo who promptly assigns her to parking duty, even though the city is dealing with a flood of missing persons cases and every cop is needed. Disappointed but undaunted, Judy applies her eagerness to her assignment, ticketing parking offenders with rabbit-like speed. In the course of her day though she has three chance encounters that change everything. The first where she impulsively helps out a fox named Nick Wild (Jason Bateman) who turns out to be a shameless con-artist, the second when she impulsively abandons her parking assignment to chase down a weasel street thief named Duke Weaselton (Alan Tudyk), and the third when she overhears a distressed otter named Mrs. Otterton (Octavia Spencer) whose husband has gone missing and whom she impulsively promises to help. Yes, Judy is most definitely impulsive but she is also doggedly dedicated to making the world a better place, no matter what the odds or the obstacles in her path. There is an enormous amount of heart in Zootopia, sometimes in the strangest of places, but it pays off in a believable way and sets the film several notches above most animated features you or your kids are likely to see.The voice cast is, in a word, excellent. Ginnifer Goodwin (Once Upon A Time, Big Love) brings Judy Hopps's combination of determination, relentless enthusiasm and heart-on-her-sleeve sensitivity out wonderfully. Justin Bateman (Arrested Development, Silver Spoons) lends his sly wise-cracking smoothness to Nick Wild but also nails it when the fox's inner vulnerability comes to the fore. Idris Elba (Luther, Beasts of No Nation) is suitably gruff and no-nonsense as Judy's boss, Chief Bogo but does give the Chief his occasional comic turn as well. J.K Simmons (Whiplash, Law & Order) is appropriately pompous and grandly image-conscious as Mayor Leodore Lionheart, and Jenny Slate (Obvious Child) does a deft turn as the deceptively meek assistant mayor, sheep Dawn Bellwether. Tommy Chong is a comic delight as the laid-back and somewhat spacey yak Yax who runs a naturist club, as is Nate Torrence (Hello Ladies) who makes the chubby donut-loving cheetah Officer Benjamin Clawhauser endearingly funny and yet sympathetic as the scenes need. Veteran voice actor Maurice LaMarche (Pinky and The Brain, Futurama and a ton of other stuff) does a comic Brando/Godfather spoof as a diminutive arctic shrew crime boss ironically named Mr. Big. Alan Tudyk (Frozen, Firefly) brings the Frozen riff with his suitably shifty weasel Duke Weaselton, an obvious nod to his Duke of Weselton role in Frozen. And if the secret of comedy is timing, Raymond S. Persi (Wreck-It Ralph) is absolute perfection as the three-toed sloth Flash, Nick's friend at the Zootopia DMV, delivering his lines with a constant wait-for-it truly sloth-like cadence.The animation is marvelous in both detail and execution, particularly when it comes to the various characters' facial expressions. Judy's swings from boundless enthusiasm and determination to moments of self-doubt, Nick's innate slyness giving way to his inner vulnerability, all are beautifully rendered, giving real depth to the characters as we see them. Flash's slo-mo sloth reactions in particular are simply priceless and by themselves make Zootopia worth catching. And in addition to the way the characters are portrayed, one of the most impressive things about Zootopia is the level of thought and detail that went into the imagining of this world where animals of all sizes and traits live and work together, from the questions of what kind of housing and transportation and general habitats would be needed to how these animals would socially interact with each other. And, most notably relating to one of the themes in the movie, what kind of attitudes and prejudices they might have about each other.The musical score by Michael Giacchino (Up, Ratatouille) is beautifully done, moving from soaring to sentimental according to the needs of the scenes. But a particular delight is the movie's song \"Try Everything\" which is sung by multi-Grammy-winning pop-star Shakira, who also provides the voice for Gazelle, a Thomson's gazelle who is Zootopia's #1 pop-star in the film.. It's sure to get an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song and would be Disney's first song to do so since \"I See The Light\" from Tangled was nominated six years ago.Note: an interesting bit of trivia for anyone who might see Zootopia in different countries is that the film actually has a different animal character for the news anchor depending on the country it'll be showing in. The US, Canada, France and Finland get a moose, China gets a panda, Australia and New Zealand get a koala, Brazil a jaguar, Japan a tanuki and supposedly the UK gets a corgi. Also, some of the voice actors used are actual newscasters. The moose anchor, Peter Moosebridge, is voiced by CBC News correspondent Peter Mansbridge, while the jaguar anchor, Boi Ch\u00e1, is voiced by Brazil's Jornal da Band anchor Ricardo Eugenio Boechat. Nice little touch, overall, one of many that Zootopia is filled to the brim with.Highly, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good imaginative story with genuine heart and memorable characters done in beautifully crafted animation.", "Like so many others I waited fingernail biting for many years. Also like many old fans I was left sorely disappointed. Now I kept my expectations relatively low for the new movie-and still it was bad! (Really bad) Most of my friends desperately wanting to keep Lucas venerated had \"it was alright/ had some cool effects\" to say, only to later join my much stronger \"I hated it\" stance. I've heard plenty of negative criticism without some specifics, so here are some of the problems with Lucas' blunder as I see them:-THE TARGET AUDIENCE: (it was kids!) Now I know the desire was to keep Star Wars available to all ages, but this failed. The original movies were mature enough in dialogue, mood, and detail to enthrall older ages, yet still accessible to younger ages (Darth is evil). This movie though, is kept accessible to its target audience while neglecting the majority of its fans.-THE COMEDY: (cheap laughs and clowning) In keeping with making a children's movie, Lucas had to ensure that all of the comedy could be understood, therefore physical buffoonery was the only out. Would it have been too much to include some subtle banter (or any verbal comedy) like that found in the other movies? (and capable of entertaining audiences older than twelve). Really though, does anything more need be said than Jar-Jar? I don't think so.-THE VIOLENCE: (can't have the kids see any) Now not that I advocate violence for its own sake, but in this film its a mix of clowning-robot breaking-safety. The first five minutes of A New Hope are more violent then this entire movie- Vader parading over the fallen bodies of the storm troopers and rebels (and this was '77, not the desensitized world of the millennium). Violence can be used as a tool to produce mood, enforce the gravity of a situation, or (as Lucas likes) a chance to have a clown dance around making light of a 'war' (I guess because we wouldn't want our target audience to become upset at all the violence)-SELF-CONTAINED WORLD: (it was not) The movie has placible accents (that are also painful) and connections with the 'real world'- i.e. the steriotypical comentators during the pod race.-THE CHARACTERS: (because I care) The characters and their interactions are boring and cardboard. The enemy is not built up at all. Sure old Mal looked pretty nifty, but what is he? The villain- he dies- oh well, whatever, nice and one sided (after all, the target audience will get it). The same emotional impact is felt when Qui-Gon dies: \"oh well\".-UNBELIEVABILITY: (suspension of disbelief has limits) Anakin is in his fighter plane, avoids dying, and accidentally shoots what turns out to be integral to the station and thereby winning the battle being 'fought' on the planet. I'm sorry I just couldn't work with it.-ANAKIN\"S FOREIGN TOUNGUE: (why? why?) Petty, maybe. Integral to the story, no. Annoying? Hell ya! Whose idea was it to have Anakin speak his rhyming gibberish? Were they going for the 'hey this sounds made up' sound, or the 'are they doing this on purpose?' sound?I apologize for not going into greater detail (because believe me, I could) but these are some of the more prominent problems to a movie that I would plan to watch again only to find all those faults that have been forgotten since seeing during its first week.My conclusion: Lucas has become drunk with success and lost his mind.", "I enjoy erotica and heard so much about this book that I had to give it a shot, but I'm five chapters in and just can't take it anymore. This has to be the most appallingly atrocious writing I've ever seen in a major release. The pseudonymous British author sets the action (such as it is) in Washington State... for no reason than that her knowledge of America apparently consists of what she read in \"Twilight\"... but the entire first-person narrative is filled with Britishisms. How many American college students do you know who talk about \"prams,\" \"ringing\" someone on the phone, or choosing a \"smart rucksack\" to take \"on holiday\"? And the author's geography sounds like she put together a jigsaw puzzle of the Pacific Northwest while drunk and ended up with several pieces in the wrong place.And oh, the repetition...and the repetition...and the repetition. I'm convinced the author has a computer macro that she hits to insert one of her limited repertoire of facial expressions whenever she needs one. According to my Kindle search function, characters roll their eyes 41 times, Ana bites her lip 35 times, Christian's lips \"quirk up\" 16 times, Christian \"cocks his head to one side\" 17 times, characters \"purse\" their lips 15 times, and characters raise their eyebrows a whopping 50 times. Add to that 80 references to Ana's anthropomorphic \"subconscious\" (which also rolls its eyes and purses its lips, by the way), 58 references to Ana's \"inner goddess,\" and 92 repetitions of Ana saying some form of \"oh crap\" (which, depending on the severity of the circumstances, can be intensified to \"holy crap,\" \"double crap,\" or the ultimate \"triple crap\"). And this is only part one of a trilogy...If I wrote like that, I'd use a pseudonym too.Like some other reviewers, what I find terribly depressing is that this is a runaway bestseller and the movie rights are expected to sell for up to $5 million. There are so many highly talented writers in the genre... and erotica is so much more erotic when the author has a command of the language and can make you care about the characters. For examples, check out the \"Beauty\" trilogy written by Anne Rice under the pen name A.N. Roquelaure, or any stories by Donna George Storey or Rachel Kramer Bussel. Just stay away from this triple crap.*UPDATE*: Thanks to the many other perturbed readers who have shared their own choices of the most annoyingly overused phrases in this masterpiece. Following up on their suggestions with my ever-useful Kindle search function, I have discovered that Ana says \"Jeez\" 81 times and \"oh my\" 72 times. She \"blushes\" or \"flushes\" 125 times, including 13 that are \"scarlet,\" 6 that are \"crimson,\" and one that is \"stars and stripes red.\" (I can't even imagine.) Ana \"peeks up\" at Christian 13 times, and there are 9 references to Christian's \"hooded eyes,\" 7 to his \"long index finger,\" and 25 to how \"hot\" he is (including four recurrences of the epic declarative sentence \"He's so freaking hot.\"). Christian's \"mouth presses into a hard line\" 10 times. Characters \"murmur\" 199 times, \"mutter\" 49 times, and \"whisper\" 195 times (doesn't anyone just talk?), \"clamber\" on/in/out of things 21 times, and \"smirk\" 34 times. Christian and Ana also \"gasp\" 46 times and experience 18 \"breath hitches,\" suggesting a need for prompt intervention by paramedics. Finally, in a remarkable bit of symmetry, our hero and heroine exchange 124 \"grins\" and 124 \"frowns\"... which, by the way, seems an awful lot of frowning for a woman who experiences \"intense,\" \"body-shattering,\" \"delicious,\" \"violent,\" \"all-consuming,\" \"turbulent,\" \"agonizing\" and \"exhausting\" orgasms on just about every page.", "I really don't like writing bad reviews. I admire people who have the courage to put pen to paper and expose themselves to the whole world, especially those writing erotica. Having just finished this book, however, I feel compelled to write a review.About half way through the book, I looked up the author to see if she was a teenager. I really did because the characters are out of a 16 year old's fantasy. The main male character is a billionaire (not a millionaire but a billionaire) who speaks fluent French, is basically a concert level pianist, is a fully trained pilot, is athletic, drop dead gorgeous, tall, built perfectly with an enormous penis, and the best lover on the planet. In addition, he's not only self made but is using his money to combat world hunger. Oh yeah, and all of this at the ripe old age of 26! And on top of that, he's never working. Every second is spent having sex or texting and emailing the female character. His billions seem to have just come about by magic. It seriously feels like 2 teenage girls got together and decided to create their \"dream man\" and came up with Christian Grey.Then come the sex scenes. The first one is tolerable but as she goes on, they become so unbelievable that it becomes more laughable than erotic. She orgasms at the drop of a hat. He says her name and she orgasms. He simply touches her and she orgasms. It seems that she's climaxing on every page.Then there's the writing. If you take out the parts where the female character is blushing or chewing her lips, the book will be down to about 50 pages. Almost on every single page, there is a whole section devoted to her blushing, chewing her lips or wondering \"Jeez\" about something or another. Then there's the use of \"shades of\". He's \"fifty shades of @#$%% up,\" \"she turned 7 shades of crimson,\" \"he's ten shades of x,y, and z.\" Seriously?The writing is just not up to par, the characters are unbelievable, and the sex verges on the comical. I don't know what happens in the remaining books and I do not intend to read them to find out. But given the maturity level of the first book, I imagine that they get married, have 2 perfect children, cure world hunger, and live happily ever after while riding into the sunset, as the female character climaxes on her horse causing her to chew her bottom lip and blush fifty shades of crimson. Jeez!", "\"Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere.\"The year is 1984; the scene is London, largest population center of Airstrip One.Airstrip One is part of the vast political entity Oceania, which is eternally at war with one of two other vast entities, Eurasia and Eastasia. At any moment, depending upon current alignments, all existing records show either that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or that it has always been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Winston Smith knows this, because his work at the Ministry of Truth involves the constant \"correction\" of such records. \"'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'\"In a grim city and a terrifying country, where Big Brother is always Watching You and the Thought Police can practically read your mind, Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. He knows the Party's official image of the world is a fluid fiction. He knows the Party controls the people by feeding them lies and narrowing their imaginations through a process of bewilderment and brutalization that alienates each individual from his fellows and deprives him of every liberating human pursuit from reasoned inquiry to sexual passion. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.Newspeak, doublethink, thoughtcrime--in 1984, George Orwell created a whole vocabulary of words concerning totalitarian control that have since passed into our common vocabulary. More importantly, he has portrayed a chillingly credible dystopia. In our deeply anxious world, the seeds of unthinking conformity are everywhere in evidence; and Big Brother is always looking for his chance. --Daniel Hintzsche --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "Satrapi's autobiography is a timely and timeless story of a young girl's life under the Islamic Revolution. Descended from the last Emperor of Iran, Satrapi is nine when fundamentalist rebels overthrow the Shah. While Satrapi's radical parents and their community initially welcome the ouster, they soon learn a new brand of totalitarianism is taking over. Satrapi's art is minimal and stark yet often charming and humorous as it depicts the madness around her. She idolizes those who were imprisoned by the Shah, fascinated by their tales of torture, and bonds with her Uncle Anoosh, only to see the new regime imprison and eventually kill him. Thanks to the Iran-Iraq war, neighbors' homes are bombed, playmates are killed and parties are forbidden. Satrapi's parents, who once lived in luxury despite their politics, struggle to educate their daughter. Her father briefly considers fleeing to America, only to realize the price would be too great. \"I can become a taxi driver and you a cleaning lady?\" he asks his wife. Iron Maiden, Nikes and Michael Jackson become precious symbols of freedom, and eventually Satrapi's rebellious streak puts her in danger, as even educated women are threatened with beatings for improper attire. Despite the grimness, Satrapi never lapses into sensationalism or sentimentality. Skillfully presenting a child's view of war and her own shifting ideals, she also shows quotidian life in Tehran and her family's pride and love for their country despite the tumultuous times. Powerfully understated, this work joins other memoirs-Spiegelman's Maus and Sacco's Safe Area Goradze-that use comics to make the unthinkable familiar. ", "This is a single-volume edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, in which the hobbit Frodo and his elfish friends get swept up in a mighty conflict with the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in Paradise Lost), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring. The book's characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in the Chronicles of Narnia, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's The Path of Daggers and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment.", "With its baroque subplots, zany political satire, morbid, cerebral humor and astonishing range of cultural references, Wallace's brilliant but somewhat bloated dirigible of a second novel (after The Broom in the System) will appeal to steadfast readers of Pynchon and Gaddis. But few others will have the stamina for it. Set in an absurd yet uncanny near-future, with a cast of hundreds and close to 400 footnotes, Wallace's story weaves between two surprisingly similar locales: Ennet House, a halfway-house in the Boston Suburbs, and the adjacent Enfield Tennis Academy. It is the \"Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment\" (each calendar year is now subsidized by retail advertising); the U.S. and Canada have been subsumed by the Organization of North American Nations, unleashing a torrent of anti-O.N.A.N.ist terrorism by Quebecois separatists; drug problems are widespread; the Northeastern continent is a giant toxic waste dump; and CD-like \"entertainment cartridges\" are the prevalent leisure activity. The novel hinges on the dysfunctional family of E.T.A.'s founder, optical-scientist-turned-cult-filmmaker Dr. James Incandenza (aka Himself), who took his life shortly after producing a mysterious film called Infinite Jest, which is supposedly so addictively entertaining as to bring about a total neural meltdown in its viewer. As Himself's estranged sons?professional football punter Orin, introverted tennis star Hal and deformed naif Mario?come to terms with his suicide and legacy, they and the residents of Ennet House become enmeshed in the machinations of the wheelchair-bound leader of a Quebecois separatist faction, who hopes to disseminate cartridges of Infinite Jest and thus shred the social fabric of O.N.A.N. With its hilarious riffs on themes like addiction, 12-step programs, technology and waste management (in all its scatological implications), this tome is highly engrossing?in small doses. Yet the nebulous, resolutionless ending serves to underscore Wallace's underlying failure to find a suitable novelistic shape for his ingenious and often outrageously funny material. "]}
